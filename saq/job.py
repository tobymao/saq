        function: the async function name to run

        queue: the saq.Queue object associated with the job
        key: unique identifier of a job, defaults to uuid1, can be passed in to avoid duplicate jobs
        timeout: the maximum amount of time a job can run for in seconds, defaults to 10 (0 means disabled)
        heartbeat: the maximum amount of time a job can survive without a heartebat in seconds, defaults to 0 (disabled)
            a heartbeat can be triggered manually within a job by calling await job.update()
        retries: the maximum number of attempts to retry a job, defaults to 1
        ttl: the maximum time in seconds to store information about a job including results, defaults to 600
        retry_delay: seconds to delay before retrying the job
        retry_backoff: If true, use exponential backoff for retry delays.
            The first retry will have whatever retry_delay is.
            The second retry will have retry_delay*2. The third retry will have retry_delay*4. And so on.
            This always includes jitter, where the final retry delay is a random number between 0 and the calculated retry delay.
            If retry_backoff is set to a number, that number is the maximum retry delay, in seconds.
        scheduled: epoch seconds for when the job should be scheduled, defaults to 0 (schedule right away)
        progress: job progress 0.0..1.0
        meta: arbitrary metadata to attach to the job

        queued: job enqueued time epoch seconds
